# What is SOFA?

SOFA (Software Orchestrated Flash Array) is a software-defined storage system to manage all flash array, and features to provide high data protection while also achieving high random access. The system provides a block device for users to read and write data, and data will be stored distributedly across all SSDs by RAID5 protection.

The advantages of SOFA includes
* only commodity hardware is needed
* data protection by RAID5
* automatic and online failed RAID recovery
* higher random data access and longer lifetime of SSD as compared to the standard software RAID5 by the special design of converting random write to sequential write
* global wear leveling across SSDs 
* web UI for system health monitoring

* Guide to install HW drivers in CentOS 8

    Please refer to the [website](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/considerations_in_adopting_rhel_8/hardware-enablement_considerations-in-adopting-rhel-8#removed-adapters_hardware-enablement) to check the devices not supported by CentOS 8.
    You can also refer to the [website](https://elrepoproject.blogspot.com/2019/08/rhel-80-and-support-for-removed-adapters.html) or [tutorial vedio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fOAuXiynYM&feature=youtu.be) to install the drivers of the unsupported hardware in CentOS 8.

## Build and Install SOFA

* Install necessary packages 
    ```
    $ uname -r
    4.18.0-147.el8.x86_64
    $ yum -y install gcc
    $ yum -y install gcc-c++
    $ yum -y install epel-release
    $ yum install kernel-devel-`uname -r`
    $ dnf --enablerepo=PowerTools install json-c-devel
    $ yum -y install rpm-build
    $ yum -y install libaio-devel
    $ yum -y install make
    $ yum -y install elfutils-libelf-devel
    ```
    If you fail on the step "yum install kernel-devel-\`uname -r\`", you may need to first do "yum update" and reboot server and then retry this step again. 

* Get source codes
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/itri-sofa/sofa.git
    ```

* Compile and build RPM package (SOFA-1.0.00.x86_64.rpm)\
    $GitClonePath is the directory path where you clone SOFA project.
    ```
    $ cd $GitClonePath/sofa
    $ sh ./gen_sofa_package.sh
    ./gen_sofa_package.sh platform=linux verion=1.0.00 release=1 tmp_dir=$GitClonePath/sofa/SOFA_Release/
    ./gen_sofa_package.sh start to generate sofa release packages
    .......................................
    .......................................
    + exit 0
    RPM Preparation Done!
    Generate sofa packages success
    ```

* Install SOFA
    ```
    $ cd packages
    $ sh ./undeploy_sofa.sh
    $ sh ./deploy_sofa.sh 
    ./deploy_sofa.sh: deply SOFA version=1.0.00 release=1

    ```

* Check SOFA installation result
    ```
    $  ls -l /usr/sofa

## Configure SOFA

* Configuration file \
The configuration file is named [sofa_config.xml](conf/sofa_config.xml), and it is placed under folder /usr/data/sofa/config after installation.

- Key settings
    - lfsm_reinstall   : Whether SOFA needs to clean previous data in the next startup \
          - value      : 0: keep previous data; 1: clean previous data

    - lfsm_cn_ssds     : The SSDs for SOFA   \
          - value      : Number of SSDs, which should be less than or equal to 64. Please make sure that lfsm_cn_ssds >= cn_ssds_per_hpeu * lfsm_cn_prgroup. The number of spare disks will be the value of lfsm_cn_ssds - cn_ssds_per_hpeu * lfsm_cn_prgroup.  \
          - settings   : List of SSD device names separated by comma. The number of SSD device names listed here must match the one in "-value" tag. Please NOT use the system disk. Please also be noted that these SSDs will be erased during SOFA startup. \

    - lfsm_seu_reserved: The permille of total space reserved for garbage collection \
          - value      : The permille of total space 

    - lfsm_gc_chk_intvl: The interval of garbage collecion checking \
          - value      : The interval expressed in milliseconds 

    - lfsm_gc_on_lower_ratio: The threshold conditioned on free space to trigger garbage collection \
          - value      : The permille of free space

* Example guide for the configurations

    This example shows you how to set up the configurations that must be changed based on your system environment. We first check out the SSDs in the machine.
    ```
    $ lsblk
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
    |-sda1   8:1    0   500M  0 part /boot
    |-sda2   8:2    0  31.4G  0 part [SWAP]
    |-sda3   8:3    0    50G  0 part /
    |-sda4   8:4    0     1K  0 part 
     -sda5   8:5    0 849.6G  0 part /home
    sdb      8:16   0 447.1G  0 disk 
    sdc      8:32   0 447.1G  0 disk 
    sdd      8:48   0 447.1G  0 disk 
    sde      8:64   0 447.1G  0 disk 
    sdf      8:80   0 447.1G  0 disk 
    sdg      8:96   0 447.1G  0 disk 
    sdh      8:112  0 447.1G  0 disk 
    ```
          
    In this example, there are 7 available SSDs from sdb to sdh, except for sda used for the operation system. If we decide to have 2 RAID5 groups with 3 SSDs each and have 1 spare disk, the configurations will be set as shown below.
    ```
    <property>
        <name>lfsm_cn_ssds</name>
        <value>7</value>
        <setting>sdb,sdc,sdd,sde,sdf,sdg,sdh</setting>
    </property>
    <property>
        <name>cn_ssds_per_hpeu</name>
        <value>3</value>
    </property>
    <property>
        <name>lfsm_cn_pgroup</name>
        <value>2</value>
    </property> 
    ```

## Run and Stop SOFA

* Run SOFA
    ```
    $ sh /usr/sofa/bin/start-sofa.sh
    ```

* Check if SOFA services are available

    Check kernel log with specific message
    ```
    $ dmesg | grep "main INFO initial all sofa components done"
    [239305.799428] [SOFA] main INFO initial all sofa components done
    ```
    
    Check if /dev/lfsm exists
    ```
    $ lsblk
    .......................................
    sdh     65:96   0 447.1G  0 disk 
    lfsm   252:0    0   1.3T  0 disk
    ```

    Now, SOFA virtual device /dev/lfsm is ready to use. You can perform RW on this virtual device just like a normal physical raw device.


* Stop SOFA
    ```
    $ sh /usr/sofa/bin/stop-sofa.sh
    ```

## Uninstall SOFA
    
* Before uninstalling SOFA, please make sure SOFA is stopped.
    ```
    $ sh $GitClonePath/sofa/packages/undeploy_sofa.sh
    ```

# SOFA Commercial Version

The advanced features includes 
* 1M IOPS for 4KB random RW over iSCSI - When the users access the block device over iSCSI from remote machines, SOFA is still able to reach 1M IOPS.
* RAID6 protection - SOFA can tolerate two disk failures for the whole system. 
* Volume manager - SOFA supports thin-provisioned volumes and snapshots.
* Scale-up - The block device provided by SOFA can be scaled up on-the-fly by using the spare disks in the machine.
* Write limit - Users can control the write amount on the SSDs to prevent disk failures. 
* High availability (HA) - Two SOFA running in active-active mode in two servers can achieve no service downtime.
